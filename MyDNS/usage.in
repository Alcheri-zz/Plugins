# let's say that my dictionary needs to meet the following rules...
rules = {

    "bar": [Required, Truthy()],
    "baz": [In(["spam", "eggs", "bacon"])],
    "qux": [Not(Range(1, 100))] # by default, Range is inclusive
}

# then this following dict would pass:
passes = {

    "bar": True, # or a non-empty string, or a non-zero int, etc...
    "baz": "spam",

    "baz": "barf",
    "qux": 99
